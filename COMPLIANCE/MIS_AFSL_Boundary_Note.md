# Managed Investment Scheme (MIS) & AFSL Boundary â€“ Working Note

- If the fund accepts capital from **other people** in a pooled arrangement where they do not control day-to-day decisions and benefits accrue to them, it may be a **managed investment scheme** (MIS) requiring registration if thresholds are met and may require an **AFSL** to operate.
- If the vehicle only recycles **its own assets** (e.g., shares assigned by founder) and **does not offer interests** to others, MIS rules may not apply. Obtain legal advice before onboarding any third-party contributors, even in-kind (e.g., founders transferring cap table stakes).
- Use **"no offers or invitations"** disclaimers on public materials to avoid inadvertent financial product promotion.
