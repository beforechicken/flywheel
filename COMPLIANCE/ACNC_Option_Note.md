# ACNC / Charity Track – Option Note

- If pursuing charitable registration, ensure purposes fit a recognised charitable head (e.g., advancing education or advancing industry). Be aware that **funding private, for‑profit startups** can be problematic unless structured as charitable activities for public benefit.
- Charities must include not‑for‑profit & winding‑up clauses and meet ACNC Governance Standards.
- Consider running a **non-charitable** mission-locked entity initially for flexibility; add a **separate charity** arm for grants/research if needed.
