# Legal

Drafting skeletons and clause libraries to brief counsel. Do not execute or adopt without legal review.

- skeletons/: Constitutions, trust deeds, protector clauses, disclosure docs (IM/PDS)
- clauses/: Mission-lock and related insertable clauses (e.g., shareholders' agreement)
- disclaimers/: Public disclaimers (e.g., no-offer)

Signed, final documents should be stored privately (not in this public repo).
