# Document Retention & Public Repo Rules

- Public-by-default: policies, governance, investment process.
- Internal-only: contracts, cap tables, IDs, bank details.
- Retention periods: governance (permanent), tax (7 years), compliance receipts (7 years), HR (as required).
- Use redaction tags and encryption for any partial public copies.
