# Contributions Policy (Non‑Refundable Gifts)

Purpose: Define how beforechicken accepts and publicly accounts for contributions while maintaining mission‑lock and regulatory boundaries.

Principles:
- Gifts, not investments: Contributions are irrevocable gifts. No units, shares, or returns.
- No refunds: Once received, contributions are not refundable.
- Transparency by default: Publish contributor name/amount/date unless opted out.
- Integrity: Decline contributions inconsistent with mission or sanctions/anti‑bribery policies.
 - Asset‑lock: Funds received are subject to the Non‑Distribution and Asset‑Lock Policy (no money out to insiders).

Process:
1. Prospective contributor reviews No‑Offer Disclaimer and How to Contribute page.
2. Contributor Form captures identity, consent to publish, and acknowledgements.
3. Funds received via approved channels; receipt issued with no‑refund terms.
4. Entry added to public Contributions Ledger (respecting privacy preference) and internal registers.

Controls:
- Screen for sanctions and unusual activity per Anti‑Bribery & Sanctions Policy.
- Keep bank statements and receipts in `INTERNAL/registers/hard`.
- Annual review of transparency pages for accuracy.
 - Apply Payments Policy and Disbursement Checklist to all outflows; publish contributions ledger entry.

This policy is not legal or tax advice. Seek counsel on applicability of MIS/AFSL and charity/DGR options if scope changes.
