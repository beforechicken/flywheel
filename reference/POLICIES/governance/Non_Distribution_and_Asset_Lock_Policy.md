# Non‑Distribution and Asset‑Lock Policy (Authoritative)

Purpose: Ensure beforechicken remains non‑extractive. No profits or assets leave the entity except for bona fide third‑party expenses and mission‑aligned deployments.

Core rules:
- No distributions: No dividends, returns of capital, buybacks, or similar transfers to insiders or contributors.
- No insider benefits: No loans, guarantees, or preferential terms to directors, officers, employees, contributors, or related parties.
- Allowed uses of funds:
  - Mission deployments: investments or grants consistent with the Investment Policy.
  - Third‑party operating expenses: arm’s‑length services necessary to operate (e.g., accounting, legal, hosting).
  - Reimbursements: at‑cost, documented with receipts, approved via disbursement checklist.
- Winding‑up asset‑lock: On winding up, transfer remaining assets to an entity with substantially identical mission‑lock.

Controls:
- Bank mandate: two authorised signatories required; no single‑user transfers.
- Disbursement checklist: required for every payment (see `OPERATIONS/Checklists/Disbursement_Control_Checklist.md`).
- Conflicts: declare and manage per Conflicts Policy; related‑party transactions require independent review and Board approval.
- Transparency: publish contributions and deployments; do not publish personal data without consent.
- Audit: annual external review of adherence to this policy and disclosures.

Governance:
- Reserved matter: any change that weakens this policy is a Reserved Matter requiring supermajority approval and Purpose Guardian non‑objection.
- Breach handling: immediate notification to the Board and Purpose Guardian; remedial plan and disclosure.

This policy is binding on directors, officers, employees, and contractors.
