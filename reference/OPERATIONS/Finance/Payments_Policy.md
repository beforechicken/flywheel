# Payments Policy (Banking and Approvals)

Purpose: Prevent extraction and control outflows in line with the Non‑Distribution and Asset‑Lock Policy.

Banking:
- Two to sign: all electronic payments require two independent authorised signatories.
- Segregation: separate operating and deployment accounts where practical.
- Whitelisting: maintain approved beneficiary list; changes require dual approval.

Approvals:
- Delegations matrix: set limits for staff/Directors; larger amounts escalate to Board.
- Documentation: no payment without invoice/contract and checklist completion.
- Related parties: only arm’s‑length reimbursements at cost; require Board approval and independent review.

Sanctions/ABAC:
- Screen counterparties per Anti‑Bribery & Sanctions Policy.

Reporting:
- Monthly summary to Board (by category) and update public transparency pages where applicable.

Breaches: Report immediately to the Board and Purpose Guardian; remediate and disclose.
