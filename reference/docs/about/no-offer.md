# No-Offer Disclaimer

Nothing in this handbook or our public materials constitutes an offer of interests or an invitation to apply for interests in a managed investment scheme or other financial product.

Contributions to beforechicken, if accepted, are treated as **nonâ€‘refundable gifts**: they are not investments, do not create units or shares, and confer no right to returns or repayment. References to 'investments' describe deployment of assets consistent with mission, not a financial product offering.
