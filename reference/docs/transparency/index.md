# Transparency

We operate in public by default. This section publishes high‑level ledgers of contributions and deployments, subject to privacy preferences and confidentiality obligations. We do not pay or distribute funds to insiders; outflows are limited to mission deployments and bona fide third‑party operating expenses.

- Contributions: gifts received to support the mission
- Deployments: investments/grants made and outcomes

See Privacy Policy outline for how we handle personal information.
