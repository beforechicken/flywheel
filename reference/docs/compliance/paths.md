# Offering Paths (Wholesale vs Retail)

This project is designed for a mission‑locked entity that recycles its own assets. If you plan to accept external funds, choose a path and get legal advice.

Contributions (Non‑Refundable Gifts):
- Accept gifts with no entitlement to financial benefits or repayment.
- Treat as donations to the entity (no DGR unless registered and endorsed).
- Not an investment offer; use clear gift terms, contributor form, and public ledger.
- Still apply sanctions/anti‑bribery checks; consider privacy/consent for publication.

Wholesale (Information Memorandum):
- Offer only to wholesale/sophisticated investors under the Corporations Act.
- Typical docs: Information Memorandum (IM), trust deed/constitution, side letters.
- AFSL: Usually required directly or via an authorised representative arrangement.
- MIS: Registration may not be required (thresholds apply), but obligations still apply.

Retail (Product Disclosure Statement):
- Offer to retail clients requires a PDS with prescribed content and ongoing disclosure.
- MIS registration and a Responsible Entity (RE) with an AFSL are generally required.
- Additional artifacts: Compliance plan, scheme constitution meeting Corps Act requirements.

Practical advice:
- Start with a wholesale IM if at all possible; retail PDS is costly and complex.
- Use strong no‑offer disclaimers until you are licensed and documents are settled.

- `LEGAL/PDS_Skeleton.md` (retail)
- Consider adding a Compliance Plan skeleton if moving to retail MIS.
