# Investments

This area holds templates and checklists used across the investment process.

- templates: Execution-ready drafts to tailor per deal
- checklists: Process aids for conflicts/related-party and diligence

Defaults: Where applicable, templates default the investor name to "beforechicken".

See also the public handbook pages in `docs/investments/` for process and template summaries.
