# New Venture Checklist (When Starting with a Partner)

Ownership structure:
- Avoid default 50/50 unless justified; align with contribution, risk, and roles.
- Ensure beforechicken holds the equity (not you personally); execute assignment if needed.

Steps:
1) Agree founder split and roles; document vesting if applicable.
2) Issue equity directly to beforechicken (preferred) or assign promptly using the Assignment Notice.
3) Record holding in `state/holdings.csv` and any gift/consideration in `state/contributions.csv`.
4) Add compliance items (ASIC registers/updates, if required).
5) If venture later pays dividends, log in `state/income.csv`; income first funds Operating Reserve.

Gate:
- No capital deployment into the venture until corpus â‰¥ AUD 2,000,000 (unless Board exception).
