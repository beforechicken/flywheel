# Financial Model — Reserve and Income Allocation

Goal: Cover recurring fees from day one, then accumulate until investing threshold is met.

Operating reserve:
- Target: multiple years of fixed costs (e.g., ASIC fees, registered office, basic accounting/legal). Choose years: [3–5].
- Funding: initial founder gift (non‑refundable) to seed the reserve.
- Custody: held in the operating account; no distributions to insiders.

Income allocation (dividends/interest):
1) Refill/maintain the operating reserve target.
2) Surplus accumulates towards the investment threshold.

Spending rules:
- Allowed: government fees, basic ops (arm’s length), and mission deployments (only after threshold).
- Prohibited: any payment to insiders except at‑cost reimbursements with receipts.

Tracking:
- Log gifts in `state/contributions.csv`.
- Log fees/expenses in `state/expenses.csv`.
- Log income (dividends/interest) in `state/income.csv`.
- Maintain holdings in `state/holdings.csv`.

Review: Board reviews reserve sizing annually; threshold changes only by supermajority.
