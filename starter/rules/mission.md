# Mission and Rules

Entity: beforechicken (Australia)

Mission: Convert resources into public‑benefit innovation. All net returns are reinvested perpetually.

Non‑negotiables:
- No money out to insiders (non‑distribution, asset‑lock)
- Perpetual reinvestment; wind‑up transfers to like‑purposed entity
- Independence and transparency with privacy options

Governance:
- Two‑to‑sign banking; conflicts managed; Purpose Guardian (optional) protects mission‑lock
- Key changes (that could enable extraction) require supermajority approval
