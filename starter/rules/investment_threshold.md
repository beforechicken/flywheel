# Investment Readiness Threshold

Principle: No external investments until the corpus reaches AUD 2,000,000.

Definition:
- Corpus = unrestricted cash and equivalents after reserving for the operating reserve target.

Rules:
- Before threshold: accumulate; no new venture investments (exceptions require supermajority and documented rationale).
- At/after threshold: investments permitted per Investment Policy and checklists.

Changes to this threshold require supermajority Board approval.
