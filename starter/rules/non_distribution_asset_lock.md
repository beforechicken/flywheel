# Non‑Distribution & Asset‑Lock

No distributions, loans, advances, or preferential payments to insiders or contributors. Funds may be used only for:
- Mission deployments (investments/grants) per Investment Policy
- Third‑party operating expenses at arm’s length
- Reimbursements at cost with receipts

Winding up: Assets transfer to an entity with substantially identical purpose and lock.
