# Payments (Two‑to‑Sign)

Controls:
- Two independent signatories for all payments
- No payments to insiders except at‑cost reimbursements with receipts
- Sanctions/ABAC checks for counterparties when applicable
- Keep evidence privately; sync CSV ledgers

Checklist (every payment):
- Purpose? (deployment vs operating vs reimbursement)
- Docs? (invoice/contract/receipts)
- Conflicts? (disclose/manage)
- Authorisations? (two signatories)

Investment gate:
- If payment is an investment/venture deployment, confirm corpus ≥ AUD 2,000,000 (see `rules/investment_threshold.md`).
- If below threshold, do not proceed unless supermajority Board approval explicitly waives the gate for this case.
