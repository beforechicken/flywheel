# Abstract Model — Invoke Change

Intent: A mission‑locked allocator that converts resources into public‑benefit progress.

Properties:
- Closed to extraction (asset‑lock); open to contribution (gifts)
- Transparent ledgers; minimal bureaucracy; decisions logged
- Ownership assigned to the fund when acquired, then stewarded by governance

Behaviours:
- Accept gifts (no refunds) → deploy to mission → reinvest any returns
- Log ownership assignments → file any legal notices → reflect in state
- Publish minimal public summaries when ready (not at start)

Invariants:
- No money out to insiders
- Conflicts managed and disclosed
- Wind‑up transfers to like‑purposed entity
