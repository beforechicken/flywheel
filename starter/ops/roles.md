# Roles and Access

Ledger maintainer:
- Updates CSV ledgers via PRs; no direct pushes
- Ensures receipts/contracts are filed privately and referenced in CSV notes

Reviewer (Board/Guardian):
- Reviews and approves PRs touching state and rules
- Confirms investment threshold compliance before deployments

Bank signatories:
- Two independent people; not both the ledger maintainer and sole approver on the same payment

Principle: twoâ€‘person integrity for any money movement or state change.
