# beforechicken â€” Minimal Starter

Copy this `starter/` folder as your seed repo. It contains only:
- state: simple CSV ledgers
- rules: mission lock and governance essentials
- compliance: key gov links with nightly link checks
- templates: a single assignment notice for ownership transfers to the fund

Private by default: Keep this repo private until you choose to publish docs.

Quickstart:
1) Edit `rules/mission.md` and fill placeholders
2) Put your bank details in `rules/contributions.md` (if accepting gifts)
3) Record any ownership assignments and deployments in `state/*.csv`
4) Run with discipline; keep it small and auditable
